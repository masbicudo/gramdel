gramdel (Grammar Definition Language)
=====================================

This is a language that can be used to define the formal grammar for other languages.

The purpose is to allow for conversion between a text in a described language, to an AST representing that text.

The gramdel language must be abled to define itself.

Also, I plan that it will allow the reverse way... that is, converting an AST back to text.
This could be the way to make converters between languages, compilers, decompilers and so on.
